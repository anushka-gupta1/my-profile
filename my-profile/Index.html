		<h3> About Me </h3>
		<p>
			My name is Anushka Gupta and I am an 18 years old Indian studying Business Administration at ESSEC Asia Pacific in Singapore . I was born and grew up in Bangalore but have lived in Singapore for four years! I stay with my parents and am an only child. I absolutely love animals, dogs in particular. I studied in GIIS, an Indian Interntional school  in Singapore before pursuing a GBBA in ESSEC Business School. I chose this university amongst others because I loved the unique multicultural experience ESSEC offers. I'm keen to work in marketing in the fashion industry and hav been working towards this goal the past few years.

		<h3> My Interests </h3>					
		<p>
			I really enjoy travelling to new places and learning about different cultures and trying new cuisines! My days are incomplete without music and meeting my friends and most importantly - Netflix. I love watching new shows and social experiments. Additionally, if I'm able to find the time, I'm an avid reader and read mystery and romance novels.
